Here is an explanation of how to use Fourier Series Demo VI.

There are four different types of signals to choose from.
•	Sinusoidal wave
•	Sawtooth wave
•	Square wave
•	Half wave rectified wave

In the next step, we must choose the specification of the signal. This includes Amplitude, Period and the Number of Fourier coefficients (N).

Upon running the VI, we will see the original signal, the Fourier Series coefficients (a0, an, and bn) and the reconstructed signal.

The reconstructed signal values can be saved to a .txt file.
It would be possible to dump the file into NI ELVIS II (or similar) kit and use Dynamic Signal Analyzer or CRO or DRO to get the waveform.
